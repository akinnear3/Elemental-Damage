Creating an element system	Start Date:July 4, 2018
-------------------------------------------------------

I want each element to have all the information about itself so that it's quick to setup import and use.

-window to add and modify/edit current element types? Yes: have it look like the pokemon type chart

Element items:
-name
-list of suppereffective (multiplyer when attacking with this element)
-list of resistant (multiplyer when defending with this element)
-method to return effectiveness (enter type(s) of target and return the multiplyer value)
(first check supereffective, multiplply any values. Then check Resistants, multiply/divide any values)

supereffective and resistant are their own class containing an element & a multiplyer
